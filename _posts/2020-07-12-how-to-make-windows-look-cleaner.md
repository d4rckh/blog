In this tutorial I will show you how to achieve the following using 2 simple and safe third party tools:
- TaskbarX
- TClock

This is my desktop

I've done the following:
- Remove cortana, taskview and search bar
- Hide desktop icons
- Change wallpaper

## TaskbarX

Let's install TaskbarX: [Download link](https://github.com/ChrisAnd1998/TaskbarX/releases/tag/1.5.6.0)

Extract it somewhere and double click the `TaskbarX.exe` file.

Your icons should now be centered, you can also customize it from the `TaskbarX Configurator.exe` file :) 

## TClock

Download TClock from: [Download link](https://github.com/White-Tiger/T-Clock) and run it

From now on you can configure it however you want

Here's my end result:
